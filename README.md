# Open-TODOs Flutter Frontend

This is the flutter app to interact with the [Open-TODOs backend](https://github.com/kottilabs/Open-TODOs).

## Getting Started

* Host your own [Open-TODOs backend](https://github.com/kottilabs/Open-TODOs) using your favourite flavour of the Docker image (available on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kottilabs/open-todos/general))
* Create a configuration file under `assets/cfg/app_settings.json` (see corresponding `.sample` file for a template).
* Deploy the app to your iOS / android device.

## Caveats

This project is in very **early development**. It lacks basic features and is not up to security standards yet.

Still, the vision of the app is to offer users the best privacy and security features achievable for an Open Source project. We will prioritize privacy over comfort features religiously.
